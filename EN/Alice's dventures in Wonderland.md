## Chapter 01 DOWN THE RABBIT-HOLE

​		Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, "and what is the use of a book," thought Alice, "without pictures or conversations?"

​		爱丽丝陪着姐姐闲坐在河边，因为无事可做，有些不耐烦。她有时偷偷地朝姐姐看的书里瞟了一两眼，发现书里既没有插图，也没有对话，心想：”一本书里既没有画儿，又没有交谈，那还有什么意思呢？“

​		So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid) whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly as White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.

​		所以她就无精打采地在心里盘算着（她也不过强撑着，应为天热，她感觉昏昏欲睡），做个雏菊花环好玩吗？为着这么个玩意值不值得爬起来去找花的麻烦呢？她真在纠结的时候，突然一只红眼睛的白兔从她身旁跑过。

​		There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself. "Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be too late!" (When she thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole unfer the hedge.

​		这本来也不是件大不了的事情，而且就算爱丽斯听见兔子自言自语道：”哦！天哪！我要迟到了！“她也不觉得这有多么离奇（事后她才觉得自己应该感觉到奇怪才对，但当时似乎一切都再平常不过）；不料那兔子竟然从它的马甲口袋里掏出一只怀表，看了一眼，然后赶忙往前走。爱丽丝立刻就站了起来，因为她突然意识到自己从来没见过兔子穿马甲，或从马甲口袋里掏出怀表来。她忍不住好奇，就紧追着兔子，飞快地跑过一片田地，刚刚赶得上看见它嘭的一声跳进篱笆底下的一个兔子洞里。

​		In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she was to get out again.

​		爱丽丝便也跟着跳了进去，压根儿没想过自己到时候怎么从洞里出来。

​		The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so sunddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down what seemed to be a very deep well.

​		那个兔子洞最开始是像隧道一样向前延伸，接着猛地下降，实在太突然了，爱丽丝跑的又那么急，还没来得及考虑如何停住，就发现自己似乎落入了一口深井里。
